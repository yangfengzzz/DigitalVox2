// ozz::animation::IKTwoBoneJob performs inverse kinematic on a three joints
// chain (two bones).
// The job computes the transformations (rotations) that needs to be applied to
// the first two joints of the chain (named start and middle joints) such that
// the third joint (named end) reaches the provided target position (if
// possible). The job outputs start and middle joint rotation corrections as
// quaternions.
// The three joints must be ancestors, but don't need to be direct
// ancestors (joints in-between will simply remain fixed).
// Implementation is inspired by Autodesk Maya 2 bone IK, improved stability
// wise and extended with Soften IK.
struct IKTwoBoneJob {
    // Validates job parameters. Returns true for a valid job, or false otherwise:
    // -if any input pointer is nullptr
    // -if mid_axis isn't normalized.

    // Normalized middle joint rotation axis, in middle joint local-space. Default
    // value is z axis. This axis is usually fixed for a given skeleton (as it's
    // in middle joint space). Its direction is defined like this: a positive
    // rotation around this axis will open the angle between the two bones. This
    // in turn also to define which side the two joints must bend. Job validation
    // will fail if mid_axis isn't normalized.

    // middle joint should point to, allowing to control IK chain orientation.

    // vector are aligned/crossing each other. It's caller responsibility to

    // starting.

    // computations. Reachability is driven by bone chain length, soften ratio and
    // target distance. Target is considered unreached if weight is less than 1.
