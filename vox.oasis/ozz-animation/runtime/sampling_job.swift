// Samples an animation at a given time ratio in the unit interval [0,1] (where
// 0 is the beginning of the animation, 1 is the end), to output the
// corresponding posture in local-space.
// SamplingJob uses a cache (aka SamplingCache) to store intermediate values
// (decompressed animation keyframes...) while sampling. This cache also stores
// pre-computed values that allows drastic optimization while playing/sampling
// the animation forward. Backward sampling works, but isn't optimized through
// the cache. The job does not owned the buffers (in/output) and will thus not
// delete them during job's destruction.
